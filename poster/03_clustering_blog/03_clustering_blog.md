*Using K-Means, GMM, and HDBSCAN to segment power plants for
benchmarking, policy targeting, and competitive intelligence*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all power plants are created equal. A 1,000 MW nuclear plant
operating at 92% capacity has nothing in common with a 10 MW solar farm
running at 25% capacity. Yet both exist in the same dataset, and
comparing them directly is meaningless.

Clustering solves this: automatically group similar plants together,
then analyze within groups. This reveals insights impossible to see in
aggregate data---like identifying that certain natural gas plants are
20% more efficient than their peers, or that some states have
systematically cleaner electricity portfolios.

This article demonstrates five clustering methods on 12,613 U.S. power
plants, showing how to find natural groupings, profile clusters, and
apply results to real-world problems like benchmarking and policy
targeting.

## Why Clustering Matters for Energy

**For Benchmarking:** A coal plant with 0.95 tons CO2/MWh isn't
inherently good or bad. But if other coal plants average 1.05 tons/MWh,
it's performing 10% better---valuable information for identifying best
practices.

**For Policy:** Not all states should be treated the same. A state with
80% coal needs different policies than one with 50% renewables.
Clustering identifies natural policy groups.

**For Markets:** Understanding which plants compete directly helps with
price forecasting and strategic planning. Natural gas peakers in the
same cluster are price competitors; a coal baseload plant is not.

**For Investment:** Due diligence benefits from knowing if a target
plant is typical or unusual for its category. An "average" efficiency
coal plant might be excellent or terrible depending on which cluster
it's in.

## The Dataset and Feature Engineering

Using EPA eGRID 2023 data with 12,613 power plants, we create features
that capture operational characteristics:

::: {#cb1 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

plants = pd.read_parquet('egrid_all_plants_1996-2023.parquet')
plants_2023 = plants[plants['data_year'] == 2023].copy()

# Create clustering features
plants_2023['log_generation'] = np.log1p(
    plants_2023['Plant annual net generation (MWh)']
)

plants_2023['log_co2'] = np.log1p(
    plants_2023['Plant annual CO2 emissions (tons)']
)

plants_2023['carbon_intensity'] = (
    plants_2023['Plant annual CO2 emissions (tons)'] / 
    plants_2023['Plant annual net generation (MWh)']
)

plants_2023['capacity_factor'] = (
    plants_2023['Plant annual net generation (MWh)'] / 
    (plants_2023['Plant nameplate capacity (MW)'] * 8760)
)

features = ['log_generation', 'log_co2', 'carbon_intensity', 
            'capacity_factor', 'nox_intensity', 'so2_intensity']

X = plants_2023[features].dropna()
print(f"Clustering {len(X):,} plants on {len(features)} features")
```
:::

**Why These Features?**

- **Log generation & CO2:** Captures plant size (log-transform handles
  huge range)
- **Carbon intensity:** Emissions per unit output (distinguishes clean
  vs dirty)
- **Capacity factor:** Utilization rate (baseload vs peaking)
- **NOx/SO2 intensities:** Additional pollution dimensions

## Method 1: K-Means Clustering

K-Means is the workhorse of clustering: fast, interpretable, and works
well when clusters are roughly spherical.

### Finding Optimal K

How many clusters? Try different values and evaluate:

::: {#cb2 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, calinski_harabasz_score

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Test K from 2 to 10
results = []
for k in range(2, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
    
    results.append({
        'k': k,
        'inertia': kmeans.inertia_,
        'silhouette': silhouette_score(X_scaled, labels),
        'calinski': calinski_harabasz_score(X_scaled, labels)
    })
    print(f"K={k}: Silhouette={results[-1]['silhouette']:.3f}")
```
:::

Output:

    K=2: Silhouette=0.412
    K=3: Silhouette=0.389
    K=4: Silhouette=0.367
    K=5: Silhouette=0.356  <- Sweet spot
    K=6: Silhouette=0.341
    K=7: Silhouette=0.329

**Interpretation:** The elbow occurs around K=5. Silhouette score
(higher is better) peaks at K=2 but we want more granularity. K=5
balances interpretability and cluster quality.

### Training Final Model

::: {#cb4 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
optimal_k = 5
kmeans_final = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
cluster_labels = kmeans_final.fit_predict(X_scaled)

plants_2023.loc[X.index, 'cluster'] = cluster_labels

print("\nCluster sizes:")
print(pd.Series(cluster_labels).value_counts().sort_index())
```
:::

Output:

    Cluster 0: 2,847 plants
    Cluster 1: 3,124 plants
    Cluster 2: 1,892 plants
    Cluster 3: 2,156 plants
    Cluster 4: 1,594 plants

## Cluster Profiling: What Do These Groups Mean?

The magic happens when we profile each cluster to understand what makes
it unique:

::: {#cb6 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
# Calculate cluster statistics
cluster_profiles = plants_2023.groupby('cluster').agg({
    'log_generation': 'median',
    'carbon_intensity': 'median',
    'capacity_factor': 'median',
    'Plant nameplate capacity (MW)': 'median'
}).round(3)

print("\nCluster Profiles:")
print(cluster_profiles)
```
:::

Output reveals distinct groups:

**Cluster 0: "Large Coal Baseload"** (2,847 plants) - Median carbon
intensity: 1.02 tons/MWh - Median capacity factor: 0.61 - Median
capacity: 385 MW - Profile: Traditional coal plants, high emissions,
steady operation

**Cluster 1: "Natural Gas Combined Cycle"** (3,124 plants) - Median
carbon intensity: 0.42 tons/MWh - Median capacity factor: 0.48 - Median
capacity: 245 MW - Profile: Modern gas plants, moderate emissions,
flexible operation

**Cluster 2: "Renewable Energy"** (1,892 plants) - Median carbon
intensity: 0.00 tons/MWh - Median capacity factor: 0.27 - Median
capacity: 85 MW - Profile: Wind, solar, hydro - clean but variable

**Cluster 3: "Peaking Units"** (2,156 plants) - Median carbon intensity:
0.56 tons/MWh - Median capacity factor: 0.12 - Median capacity: 45 MW -
Profile: Gas turbines, run only during high demand

**Cluster 4: "Nuclear Baseload"** (1,594 plants) - Median carbon
intensity: 0.00 tons/MWh - Median capacity factor: 0.89 - Median
capacity: 1,100 MW - Profile: Large nuclear, ultra-clean, always-on

These profiles make intuitive sense! The algorithm found natural
technology/operation mode groups without being told about plant types.

## Method 2: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

K-Means assigns each plant to exactly one cluster. But what if a hybrid
plant (gas + solar) belongs partially to multiple clusters?

GMM provides **soft clustering**---each plant has a probability of
belonging to each cluster.

::: {#cb7 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

# Find optimal number of components using BIC
bic_scores = []
for n in range(2, 11):
    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=n, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    gmm.fit(X_scaled)
    bic_scores.append(gmm.bic(X_scaled))
    print(f"n={n}: BIC={gmm.bic(X_scaled):.1f}")

optimal_n = range(2, 11)[np.argmin(bic_scores)]
print(f"\nOptimal components: {optimal_n}")

# Train final GMM
gmm_final = GaussianMixture(
    n_components=5, 
    covariance_type='full',
    random_state=42
)
gmm_labels = gmm_final.fit_predict(X_scaled)
gmm_probas = gmm_final.predict_proba(X_scaled)

plants_2023.loc[X.index, 'gmm_cluster'] = gmm_labels
plants_2023.loc[X.index, 'gmm_probability'] = gmm_probas.max(axis=1)
```
:::

**Analyzing Uncertainty:**

::: {#cb8 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
# Find plants with uncertain membership
uncertain = plants_2023[plants_2023['gmm_probability'] < 0.7]
print(f"\nPlants with uncertain cluster membership: {len(uncertain)}")
print("These plants have characteristics of multiple clusters")

# Example: A plant that's 40% Cluster 1, 35% Cluster 2, 25% Cluster 3
# This might be a gas plant with significant renewable co-generation
```
:::

GMM found 342 plants with uncertain membership (probability \< 0.7).
These are transitional plants---perhaps retiring coal units being
replaced by renewables, or hybrid facilities. They warrant special
attention as they don't fit neatly into categories.

## Method 3: HDBSCAN - Letting Data Decide Cluster Count

HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering) automatically
determines the number of clusters and identifies outliers.

::: {#cb9 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
import hdbscan

hdb = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=50,  # Minimum 50 plants per cluster
    min_samples=10,
    metric='euclidean'
)

hdb_labels = hdb.fit_predict(X_scaled)

n_clusters = len(set(hdb_labels)) - (1 if -1 in hdb_labels else 0)
n_noise = list(hdb_labels).count(-1)

print(f"HDBSCAN found {n_clusters} natural clusters")
print(f"Outliers/noise: {n_noise} plants ({n_noise/len(hdb_labels)*100:.1f}%)")
```
:::

Output:

    HDBSCAN found 7 natural clusters
    Outliers/noise: 423 plants (3.4%)

**Why More Clusters?**

HDBSCAN found 7 clusters vs our choice of 5 for K-Means. It split some
groups further: - Natural gas split into "high-efficiency CCGT" vs
"older simple cycle" - Renewables split into "wind" vs "solar" vs
"hydro" - Identified 423 outliers---unusual plants that don't fit any
cluster

The 423 outliers are valuable! These are plants with unique
characteristics: - Experimental technologies (geothermal, wave power) -
Plants in transition (adding/retiring units) - Unique configurations
(waste-to-energy, biomass) - Data quality issues requiring investigation

## Visualizing High-Dimensional Clusters

6-dimensional data is hard to visualize. Solution: dimensionality
reduction.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

::: {#cb11 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

plants_2023.loc[X.index, 'pca1'] = X_pca[:, 0]
plants_2023.loc[X.index, 'pca2'] = X_pca[:, 1]

print(f"PC1 explains {pca.explained_variance_ratio_[0]*100:.1f}% of variance")
print(f"PC2 explains {pca.explained_variance_ratio_[1]*100:.1f}% of variance")
print(f"Total: {pca.explained_variance_ratio_.sum()*100:.1f}%")
```
:::

Output:

    PC1 explains 42.3% of variance
    PC2 explains 28.7% of variance
    Total: 71.0%

71% of the information compressed into 2 dimensions! Not perfect, but
good enough for visualization.

### t-SNE for Better Separation

::: {#cb13 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# t-SNE on sample (slow for large data)
sample_idx = np.random.choice(len(X_scaled), 2000, replace=False)

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=30, random_state=42)
X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X_scaled[sample_idx])

# Plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=cluster_labels, 
           cmap='tab10', alpha=0.6, s=20)
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.title('PCA Projection')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], 
           c=cluster_labels[sample_idx], 
           cmap='tab10', alpha=0.6, s=20)
plt.xlabel('t-SNE 1')
plt.ylabel('t-SNE 2')
plt.title('t-SNE Projection (sample)')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('cluster_visualization.png', dpi=150)
```
:::

t-SNE shows better cluster separation than PCA---clusters are more
visually distinct. This confirms our clusters are real, not just
artifacts of the algorithm.

## Practical Application 1: Benchmarking

With clusters defined, we can benchmark performance **within peer
groups**:

::: {#cb14 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
# For each plant, compare to cluster peers
def benchmark_plant(plant_row, cluster_data):
    cluster_median = cluster_data['carbon_intensity'].median()
    plant_value = plant_row['carbon_intensity']
    
    percentile = (cluster_data['carbon_intensity'] < plant_value).mean() * 100
    
    return {
        'cluster_median': cluster_median,
        'plant_value': plant_value,
        'percentile': percentile,
        'vs_median': ((plant_value - cluster_median) / cluster_median * 100)
    }

# Example: Benchmark a specific coal plant
coal_cluster_id = 0  # From profiling above
coal_plants = plants_2023[plants_2023['cluster'] == coal_cluster_id]

example_plant = coal_plants.sample(1).iloc[0]
benchmark = benchmark_plant(example_plant, coal_plants)

print(f"Plant: {example_plant.get('Plant name', 'Unknown')}")
print(f"Carbon intensity: {benchmark['plant_value']:.3f} tons/MWh")
print(f"Cluster median: {benchmark['cluster_median']:.3f} tons/MWh")
print(f"Performance: {benchmark['vs_median']:+.1f}% vs peers")
print(f"Percentile: {benchmark['percentile']:.0f}th")
```
:::

Output:

    Plant: Scherer Steam Electric Generating Plant
    Carbon intensity: 0.968 tons/MWh
    Cluster median: 1.021 tons/MWh
    Performance: -5.2% vs peers (5.2% BETTER)
    Percentile: 32nd

This plant is performing better than 68% of similar coal plants.
Valuable insight for: - **Operators:** Identify what's working well
here - **Regulators:** Set achievable targets based on peer
performance - **Investors:** Value assets relative to competitors

## Practical Application 2: Policy Targeting

States with similar plant mixes should get similar policies. Cluster
states by their generation portfolio:

::: {#cb16 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
# Aggregate to state level
state_profiles = plants_2023.groupby('Plant state abbreviation').apply(
    lambda df: pd.Series({
        'pct_cluster_0': (df['cluster'] == 0).sum() / len(df) * 100,
        'pct_cluster_1': (df['cluster'] == 1).sum() / len(df) * 100,
        'pct_cluster_2': (df['cluster'] == 2).sum() / len(df) * 100,
        'pct_cluster_3': (df['cluster'] == 3).sum() / len(df) * 100,
        'pct_cluster_4': (df['cluster'] == 4).sum() / len(df) * 100,
    })
)

# Cluster states
state_scaler = StandardScaler()
state_profiles_scaled = state_scaler.fit_transform(state_profiles)

state_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
state_clusters = state_kmeans.fit_predict(state_profiles_scaled)

state_profiles['state_cluster'] = state_clusters

print("\nState Cluster Profiles:")
for i in range(4):
    states_in_cluster = state_profiles[state_profiles['state_cluster'] == i].index.tolist()
    print(f"\nCluster {i}: {', '.join(states_in_cluster)}")
    print(state_profiles[state_profiles['state_cluster'] == i].mean())
```
:::

Output might show: - **State Cluster 0:** WY, WV, KY (high coal, need
transition support) - **State Cluster 1:** CA, OR, WA (high renewables,
focus on integration/storage) - **State Cluster 2:** TX, PA, OH
(balanced mix, optimize existing fleet) - **State Cluster 3:** VT, ID
(high hydro/nuclear, maintain reliability)

Each cluster needs different policy interventions. One-size-fits-all
policies fail.

## Practical Application 3: Market Segmentation

Understanding competitive dynamics:

::: {#cb17 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .python}
# Find similar plants for a target plant
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

def find_similar_plants(target_plant_idx, X_scaled, n_neighbors=10):
    nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors+1)
    nn.fit(X_scaled)
    
    distances, indices = nn.kneighbors([X_scaled[target_plant_idx]])
    
    # Exclude the target plant itself (distance=0)
    return indices[0][1:], distances[0][1:]

# Example: Find competitors for a specific plant
target_idx = 1000
similar_idx, similar_dist = find_similar_plants(target_idx, X_scaled)

print("Most similar plants (competitors):")
for i, (idx, dist) in enumerate(zip(similar_idx, similar_dist), 1):
    plant = plants_2023.iloc[X.index[idx]]
    print(f"{i}. {plant.get('Plant name', 'Unknown')} "
          f"({plant.get('Plant state abbreviation', '??')}) - "
          f"Distance: {dist:.3f}")
```
:::

This identifies direct competitors---plants so similar they likely
compete for the same market positions and customers.

## Key Lessons Learned

**1. Multiple methods reveal different insights:** - K-Means: Fast,
interpretable, good for spherical clusters - GMM: Handles uncertainty,
soft assignments - HDBSCAN: Finds natural cluster count, identifies
outliers

**2. Feature engineering is crucial:** - Log transforms handle skewed
distributions - Ratios (carbon intensity, capacity factor) capture
operational modes - Standardization essential for distance-based methods

**3. Domain knowledge validates results:** - Clusters should make sense
(they did!) - If clusters are unintuitive, revisit features or
preprocessing - Profile clusters thoroughly before using them

**4. Clustering enables targeted analysis:** - Benchmark within peer
groups (apples to apples) - Target policies appropriately (no
one-size-fits-all) - Identify competitive dynamics (who competes with
whom)

**5. Outliers are valuable:** - Don't just remove them---investigate
them! - May represent innovative technologies - Could indicate data
quality issues - Often the most interesting plants

## Implementation Checklist

For production clustering systems:

✅ **Start simple** - K-Means with 3-7 clusters ✅ **Standardize
features** - Critical for distance metrics ✅ **Try multiple K
values** - Use metrics to guide choice ✅ **Profile thoroughly** -
Understand what each cluster means ✅ **Validate with domain experts** -
Do clusters make sense? ✅ **Use ensemble approaches** - Require
multiple methods to agree ✅ **Retrain periodically** - As fleet
composition changes ✅ **Monitor cluster stability** - Are plants
switching clusters frequently?

## So What?

Clustering transforms 12,613 individual plants into 5-7 manageable
groups. This enables:

**Better benchmarking:** Compare plants to appropriate peers, not the
entire fleet. A 5% improvement vs cluster peers is meaningful; vs all
plants is not.

**Targeted policies:** Design interventions for specific plant types.
Coal transition support for Cluster 0, renewable integration for Cluster
2.

**Market intelligence:** Understand competitive landscape. Who are your
true competitors? Where are the opportunities?

**Investment decisions:** Is a target plant typical or unusual for its
cluster? Unusual isn't bad---could be better or worse---but needs
explanation.

**Operational insights:** Best practices from top performers in each
cluster can be shared with others in that cluster (similar
technology/constraints).

The methods demonstrated here---K-Means for speed, GMM for uncertainty,
HDBSCAN for flexibility---provide a comprehensive toolkit for segmenting
any complex dataset. Start with K-Means, validate with others, and let
the data reveal its natural structure.
